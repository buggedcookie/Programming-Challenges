#### Constraints List

| **Constraint Name**     | **Rules**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **100 Lines Only**      | Program must be no more than 100 lines of code. No external libraries allowed.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Code Golf**           | Solve the problem using the fewest characters possible. Minimize code size.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **No Libraries**        | Cannot use any external libraries or frameworks. Only standard language features allowed.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **No Loops**            | No loops (`for`, `while`, etc.) allowed. Solve using recursion only.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **One File Challenge**  | Entire program must fit in a single file. No additional modules or files allowed.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **One Function/Method** | Program must be written in a single function. No helper functions or classes.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Reinvent the Wheel**  | Do not use any external or built-in libraries. Not even any standard utilities like `math`, `random`, or `collections`Â etc... Only basic language primitives (loops, conditions, classes, methods, variables, basic file/client/server I/O) are allowed. |
| **Resource Limitation** | Solve the problem with strict limits on resources (e.g., CPU, memory, or network usage).                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Single Variable**     | Solve the problem using only **one** variable for the entire program. The type doesn't matter.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Speedrun**            | Build the entire program as fast as possible. Avoid libraries that do 99% of the work, your speed should come from your skill, not shortcuts.                                                                                                            |
| **Time Limit**          | Create the entire program within a defined time window (e.g., 1 to 8 hours).                                                                                                                                                                             |

> The bigger the challenge is, the more fun some of these constraints become!

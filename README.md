# Programming Challenges

Welcome to the **Programming Challenges** repository, a collection of programming problems. Use them to improve your skills, learn new concepts, or just challenge yourself for fun!

## About

This isn't meant to be a clean collection of perfect solutions, just my own takes, experiments, and learning process. Some solutions are clean, others are an absolute mess. There's all sorts of challenges here, easy or hard.

If anything here inspires you or makes you want to try a challenge yourself, that's awesome, good luck!

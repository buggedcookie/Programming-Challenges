## Contributing Guidelines

#### Improving Existing Solutions

My solutions are personal attempts and often messy due to my unwillingness of doing better: your improvements, optimizations, or alternative approaches are very welcome! Feel free to suggest changes or better ways to solve a challenge. Just careful to keep it readable for most people, and if possible, add explanation to your changes.

#### Adding New Challenges or Ideas

If you want to add a new challenge, please place it in one of these existing categories:

- **Programs**: Algorithms, logic, and small code challenges (not full apps or games)

- **Applications**: Full applications with features and persistence

- **Games**: Simple or more complex game implementations

- **Miscellaneous**: Anything that doesn’t fit the above

If you think a new category is needed, suggest it, just keep categories broad and avoid making them too specific.

#### Writing Guides or Explanations

When adding a guide or explanation, please:

- Put it inside the challenge's folder.

- Name it `Guide.md` or `ReadMe.md`.

- Include any sources or references you used (no URL shorteners; use full, trusted URLs).

- Explain your reasoning, assumptions, and steps, not just "do this and that. Use clear inference and visualization whenever possible.

> A good guide doesn't just show *how* but explains *why* and *when*. Most people read tutorials because they don't understand the concept yet and help them learn by breaking down ideas clearly.

- Write for beginners or people new to the topic.

#### Guide.md vs ReadMe.md

- **`Guide.md`**
  For walking through **how to build or implement** the solution from scratch. Ideal for learners who want to understand the logic and design behind the code.

- **`ReadMe.md`**
  For explaining **how to use** the finished program: instructions, commands, and expected behavior.

#### What Not to Do

- Please **do not submit fully completed solutions** as pull requests. 
  This repo is mainly a personal progress tracker. It’s public to inspire others, and so I can learn myself.

- Avoid overcomplicating explanations. 
  Clarity and simplicity are key. While detailed reasoning is encouraged, keep explanations straightforward and easy to follow.
